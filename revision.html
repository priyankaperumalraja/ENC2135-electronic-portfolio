        TEDTalk vs. Corporate Article: The Digital Divide from Different Perspectives
      <p/>
      <p class="gmnd lead px-7 text-left fw-bold my-0">Introduction</p>
      <p class="gmnd lead px-7 mb-5 text-left indented-paragraph"> 
	Technology is increasingly becoming a necessity in social, educational, professional, and daily environments, yet digital literacy is not present throughout the entire population. Millions of people around the world don’t have access to technology such as cell phones, computers, and internet, all of which have become some of the most influential and necessary components of succeeding in the educational and professional world. Even if people do have access to modern tech, its value diminished when they cannot use technology efficiently with the ultimate goal of improving an aspect  of one’s life. These issues surround what is known as the digital divide, the divide between people who have access to technology and digital literacy and people who don’t, as well as the barriers created because of this. Since technology is integrated significantly in most people’s lives, the digital divide is often overlooked or misunderstood, but bringing awareness to the issue is essential to fostering support for bridging the divide.

  <p class="gmnd lead px-7 text-left fw-bold my-0">Analysis of Artifact #1</p>
  <p class="gmnd lead px-7 mb-5 text-left indented-paragraph">
One source that discusses and brings awareness to the digital divide is a TEDTalk by Jim Sevier, an entrepreneur interested in how technology can be utilized in business and everyday life. He talks about how the digital divide is the divide between people who can access and use technology and people who cannot, and that the main reasons as to why this divide exists is due to a lack of skill, knowledge, or financial ability to access and use technology. Sevier’s main method of describing the digital divide is through a metaphor, describing the gap between a train platform and a train as the digital gap, the train as technological world, and the platform as the non-technological world. People who are able to cross the gap and enter the train are those who have the means to access, use, and understand technology that those who are left on the platform cannot. He then continues to describe the premise of some of his favorite Daniel Suarez books, that people use somatic movements, or physical movements, to access the digital world (a.k.a., allow people without the ability to access technology to do so). Despite Suarez’s book being fiction, Sevier believes the idea of making technology accessible to all, rather than attempting to make more of the population able to use technology, will be more successful long term.

The audience of the TEDTalk is most likely people who are specifically interested in technology and its impacts and more generally people who enjoy learning from TEDTalks. Jim Sevier’s goal with his talk is to spread awareness on the digital divide and empower others to support initiatives that actively work to bring technology resources and knowledge to underserved communities. His talk utilized pathos through the train and platform metaphor, allowing the audience to understand the barrier of the digital divide through an event that they are more likely to relate to. Sevier also used logos when he described how the solution to fully bridging the digital divide isn’t attempting to making everyone digitally literate (although it is essential that initiatives are taken toward this), but to make technology accessible regardless of prior skill or knowledge, ultimately solving the issue of being unable and unmotivated to use tech and shifting focus to making the tech itself available.

Jim Sevier establishes his credibility on knowing the impact of having and not having technology by explaining how he was born in the 60s and lived in an age with and without technology. He explains how, when he was younger, he “used rotary telephones and…solved complex math problems with a pencil and a piece of paper”, both of which are drastically different from cell phones and calculators we use today (Sevier). Sevier’s presentation is in the form of a TEDTalk, indicating a strong level of expertise or knowledge on the subject, in this case the technological divide. Sevier doesn’t explicitly state any academic credentials, just his experience as a person who grew up before the age of mass technology use, but the recognizable, credible stage of TED indicates that he must have some strong level of experience and knowledge on the technological divide since TED is a highly selective organization that conducts thorough background checks and interviews on each speaker.

<p class="gmnd lead px-7 text-left fw-bold my-0">Analysis of Artifact #2</p>
<p class="gmnd lead px-7 mb-5 text-left indented-paragraph">
Another artifact that brings awareness to the digital divide is an article from Education Connection, a higher education consultation organization, describing what the digital divide is, its causes, why its significant, its examples, and the solutions to combat it. Some of the main auses of digital divide they address are financial, geographical, infrastructure, and access barriers. The article also addresses the impact of virtual schools on the digital divide, stating that with the increased popularity of virtual schools after the COVID-19 pandemic, students who do not have high-speed internet, computers, or basic digital literacy skills are at a disadvantage when it comes to taking advantage of the flexibility and accessibility virtual schooling provides. The article also addresses how students without reliable internet or a home computer may not be able to complete online homework assignments, potentially resulting in lowered grades and performance. Ways to combat these issues addressed in the article are organizations who work toward connecting people to internet, computers, and digital literacy resources, the government actively funding projects that make technology and internet more accessible, and raising awareness of the digital divide so more people can support initiatives to bridge the divide.

The audience of this article are potentially students, who are either researching this topic or is associated with Education Connection, and people who are interested in technology and its impacts. The author’s goal with this article is, more generally, to educate the audience on the digital divide and bring awareness to the issue. Less obviously, since this is a higher education consultation organization that is ultimately looking for new clients, it seems that this article is also attempting to showcase the style of education and resources available in Education Connection, shown through custom infographics available for download, and advertisements for getting matched with a course throughout the article. The article also incorporates pathos by adjectively describing the people who are affected by the digital divide and the issues they will face without reliable technology. The article also incorporates ethos by stating that “the digital divide is not only a matter of fairness and justice but also crucial for fostering inclusive economic growth and societal well-being” (Education Connection), making the reader feel that it is ethical and right to help bridge the digital divide gap.

Education Connection is an higher educational organization, so it can be assumed that they have some expertise in teaching a subject like the technological divide. Aside from this, it is initially unclear whether they are a credible source of information, especially considering they are a for-profit organization. The audience of the Education Connection article is people who are looking for higher education consultation or knowledge. The article is written in a language that is easy to comprehend and includes many infographics, allowing the reader to understand the concepts of the digital divide much easier than if they were reading an academic paper. Throughout the article, many advertisements for Education Connection’s matching services and infographics with open-source code attached are present, which makes it very likely that the readability and simplicity of the article is, in part, showcasing how easy it is for users to learn through Education Connection and persuading the audience subconsciously to trust their material and enroll in their programs.
 
The formality of the article also portrays the type of content Education Connection provides and their intended audience. The article is written in a very informal manner, rarely ever using highly scientific terminology and explaining the topics in a step-wise manner. In the article’s introduction, casual and informal language like “came into play” and “hot-button” is used to cater to an audience who may not have background knowledge on the subjects, so they are making the article as comprehensible as possible (Education Connection). As previously mentioned, the use of infographics also decreases the formality of the article and suggests its information to cater to all demographics regardless of education level or experience. 
<p/>
<p class="gmnd lead px-7 text-left fw-bold my-0">Comparison of Both Artifacts</p>
<p class="gmnd lead px-7 mb-5 text-left indented-paragraph">
Despite the differences between both artifacts, they both have the same primary goal of informing its audience about the digital divide. The artifacts’ secondary goals are what distinguish themselves, serving a purpose either for themselves or for others. The TEDTalk by Jim Sevier establishes credibility almost immediately from him conducting a TEDTalk itself. TED is a highly credible organization, so his presence as a speaker assumes his credibility without any prior knowledge of his background. The Education Connection article, on the other hand, does not establish its credibility as immediately as Sevier’s talk since it is initially unclear whether the information present is reliable. The various goals of articles can influence the presentation and prose of its information, and this variation makes establishing articles’ credibility more difficult, requiring further research to understand the origin, goals, and motivating factors of the source. In the case of Education Connection, a higher education consultation organization, it’s secondary goals are to persuade readers to sign up with their consultation and education services, which are made apparent through the article’s use of advertisements, custom infographics with open-source code, and a presentation of the simple and easy to understand layout of their services. With this goal in mind, the site may write their information in less of an objective manner and more of a subjective one, causing the reader to gain an unclear understanding of the digital divide. 
<p/>
<p class="gmnd lead px-7 text-left fw-bold my-0">Conclusion</p>
<p class="gmnd lead px-7 mb-5 text-left indented-paragraph">
Jim Sevier’s TEDTalk and Education Connection’s article both discuss the digital divide but employ different rhetorical strategies to accomplish goals aside from informing the public. For Jim Sevier, his goal is to motivate the audience, who consists primarily of people who are involved in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector or are already passionate about bridging the digital divide, to care about the digital divide and play a part in its eradication. He accomplished this goal through many rhetorical strategies, some of which are establishing his credibility by presenting a TEDTalk, using pathos to connect the audience to the issue and allow them to relate using the subway metaphor, and speaking on the logical methods of bridging the digital divide like creating way to make anyone, regardless of ability or previous knowledge, to use technology. Education Connection’s goals are different than Sevier’s but employ some of the same rhetorical strategies to achieve them. Their goal is to get their audience, which consists primarily of students and people who need higher education consulting, to sign up with their services. They accomplish this by spreading advertisements throughout the article so as the reader continues, they are forced to read the advertisement about their services and consider it. They also attempt to establish credibility by showcasing their educational resources through the article’s infographics and easy to read language and layout. Both artifacts represent how rhetorical strategies can greatly influence an audience towards an established goal.
